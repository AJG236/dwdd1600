        <h1>The History of Flags</h1>
        <h2>Origins of Flags</h2>
        <p>The first flag in recorded history is difficult to pinpoint precisely because flags, as symbols of identity,
            have evolved over millennia and were often made of perishable materials. However, here’s what we know from
            historical evidence:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Sumerians (~3000 BCE)</dt>
            <dd>
                The Sumerians in Mesopotamia used vexilloids — early flag-like standards mounted on poles. These were
                typically made of wood or metal and depicted animals or religious symbols. The <em>Standard of Ur</em>
                is a famous example showing such standards in use.
            </dd>

            <dt>Egyptians (~3100 BCE)</dt>
            <dd>
                Ancient Egyptians used territorial standards to represent their nomes (districts). These were mounted
                emblems, often featuring gods or animals, not made of cloth but serving symbolic and unifying purposes.
            </dd>

            <dt>Chinese (Zhou Dynasty, ~11th century BCE)</dt>
            <dd>
                The first true cloth flags are believed to have emerged in ancient China during the Zhou dynasty. These
                fabric flags were used for military identification and communication across large formations.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>So, while the first true "flag" (as a piece of cloth on a pole) likely emerged in ancient China, the concept
            of flags as symbolic identifiers goes back to ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, over 5,000 years ago.
